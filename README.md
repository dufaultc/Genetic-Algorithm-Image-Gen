# Genetic-Algorithm-Image-Gen
This is a class project I completed with a partner using C wherein a randomly generated image is mutated to resemble a specified image using a genetic algorithm. The main.c, crossover.c, and a4.h files were not created by me.

The video shows the evolution of a random image to resemble the mcmaster.ppm image. This video was created by outputting an image of the random image every 100 iterations of the mutation process and using a bash script to attach the images together.

To run on command line, download all files, type "make escher" or "make mcmaster" and enter, and the outputted image will be placed into the escher2.ppm and mcmaster2.ppm files.
